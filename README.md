# stable-scroll-vh-ios
A Simple JavaScript utility to stabilize viewport height units (svh, lvh) on iOS and prevent scroll jitter. Some iOS in-app browsers or non-Safari browsers may incorrectly interpret svh and lvh similar to dvh, causing layout issues. This module ensures consistent viewport sizing for mobile web apps affected by these quirks.
